                  <p>The goal of this project is to create a packet sniffing tool that is capable of filtering for packets of a specific type, from a specific
                   source, or sent to a specific destination. This tool is both modular and simple. By the end of the project the tool was capable of sniffing for packets of a specific type and then checking if that packet is an echo-request type packet. If the packet was, then the tool took the destination address of 
                   said packet, used that address as the source, and then sent a spoofed echo-reply to that request. This tool was made on the linux platform using
                   Python and Scapy and was tested by using two separate virtual machines. The below picture is a snippet of the tool by the end of the project. The full documentation of the lab is linked below. This document has more in depth pictures and a step by step walkthrough of what I did. </p>

                  <hr class="star-primary">
                  <p>The goal of this project was to create a certificate authority (CA), implant that CA in the firefox browser, and then use that
                  CA to establish a secure SSL connection with a web server. This process involved first creating the self signed root certificate for the CA.
                  This root certificate is then used to sign signing requests made by webservers that wish to establish secure connections. The webserver
                  must generate a key pair, and then send a signing request that includes their public key. The details of this lab and the step by step process 
                  are outlined in detail within the document attached. The below image shows the certificate information in the browser after connection
                  has been established. </p>

                  This project is actually one of my first times using Python and was completed before I took steps to start learning the language. It was an interesting experience to have to learn on the fly while completing this project for an assignment grade and I found that I really liked the simplicity in the syntax of Python. The link below contains the full document of this project and the smaller steps taken in building the script. </p>

                  <p>This was a project I completed for my IST 110 class at Penn State. The project was to take an app that already existed and make a new feature for it. The app modified was Kakao Talk, which is a messenging app. The features added in this prototype is an "group food order" feature. The concept is that if youre in a group with your friends, someone can initiate a group order. Working similar to github there would be multiple restaurants to choose from and order from at once. Once the order was created everyone in the group would be able to edit the order at the same time and then once the order was submitted everyones order would go through together. The prototype is a mockup of what it would look like and offers very limited functionality. For this project I used the program proto.io.</p>
                  <p>The interactive parts of this prototype are the menu pullover in the top right corner from the chat page. From there the fork an knife icon will take you to the order page. You can view your order from the list icon in the top right corner and the list of places would be a variety of restaurants. The "Pizza Restaurant" icon is the one that is interactive. Then you would choose from their menu items and hit the plus icon to add it to your orders. From there you can view your order in the orders page and that is also where you would submit your order.</p>

                  <p>Study Goal: The goal of this study is to determine what aspects of mobile shopping would attract more users from the ages of 18-25. Mobile (app) shopping doesn’t have as much traction as desktop shopping so the goal is to determine what aspects users like about both and what aspects would draw more user towards a mobile shopping approach. Typically, users like a convenient experience so I will try and determine what factors would make mobile shopping convenient. </p>
                  <p>Target Audience: The target audience is college students. This audience is most likely to embrace shopping through apps because they understand technology better than older generations. They also have more financial independence than younger generations. This puts them in the ideal position to transition from desktop based online shopping to a more convenient mobile option. College students are also very mobile throughout the day so a more convenient shopping option would be more easily adopted. </p>
                  <p>Research Methods: For this project I conducted interviews to gather information about mobile shopping design. Interviews allowed me to directly interact with users of these applications and determine aspects people liked and disliked.</p>
                  <p> Recruitment: I recruited my users by asking piers if they would like to participate in a short interview. They then went through the online survey to determine if they fit the criteria. </p>
                  <p> Number of Participants: 3</p>
                  <p>Key Insights: Applications save information, Desktop is more usable overall, UI isn't optimal on mobile.</p>

                  <p>Study Goal: The goal of this design is to streamline the process of testing different paint colors within a room. The app allows users to see what their room looks like with different colors built into the app by using augmented reality technology. This gets rid of the need of paint swatches in the home renovation process and allows for a better visualization of what a room would look like after being painted. The convenience offered by this app would save the user in both time and frustration when taking on renovation projects. </p>
                  <p>Target Audience: The target audience of this app are people within the ages of 23 – 40 that are interested in or actively participate in home renovations of any nature. It also includes people that renovate for a career and frequently paint with different colors. The target is from 23 – 40 because anyone younger is likely not renovating/repainting their home because they’re too young to own a home, and the top restriction of 40 is because people beyond that age likely wouldn’t want to use an app. </p>

He is familiar with the process of renovating and they are trying to choose a new color for their bedroom. They’re very conflicted on colors and the small paint swatches aren’t helping them visualize the color in the room well. Rich is also frustrated because he had to go back to the store for new colors once already and doesn’t like going back and forth. He wishes there was an easier way to use his phone and make things easier.</p>

Uses an Apple iPhone and is very familiar with apps.Details: Enjoys being able to preplan out projects on visual studio programs before beginning renovations. User Goals: Rachel is 32 and helping a couple design their master bedroom. She has ideas for colors and wants to show the couple what it would look like with the room fully painted to get their opinion. The couple likes some of the colors but wants to sample a few more before they make a decision. Rachel is finding it difficult to accurately visualize the complete room with some of the colors and wishes there was a better way for the couple to see the outcome. She wishes there was a technology feature that she could quickly demo the outcomes for her clients. </p>

                  <h2>Park-It Group Project</h2>
                  <hr class="star-primary">
                  <p><strong>Key Responsibilities:</strong> My responsibilities for this project were to work with the team to develop a strong study goal but mostly I worked on the prototype. I was responsible for the design of the prototype, the creation of it, and the implementation of the functionalities to the prototype. Once we were given feedback about our initial prototype I was responsible for making updates to the prototype to reflect these changes. For the design of the prototype I used AdobeXD and for the implementation of the functionality I used Invision.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Study Goal:</strong> Searching for parking is nuisance for many people who live in urban areas, commute, or simply enjoy attending large events. While there are often sections that are numbered and lettered in large areas, many people forget where they park their car, while others have a very hard time even searching for a spot; this causes an enormous waste of time for many people. While there are apps that provide users with parking prices, and available garages, there are none to our knowledge that provides specific details. Details such as exact location of parking spot, availability of spaces, and even more detailed information about where an available spot is located. Team 6 plans on exploring how we can provide a mobile application that will help with this problem.  </p>
                  <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> The community we’ve decided to focus on is for this specific project is drivers in State College, specifically around the Penn State campus.  while this may change in the future for expansion. However, we have chosen Penn State due to the large volume of people that attend the many sporting events, concerts, enjoy tailgating, and other events that take place on campus. 
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Research Methods:</strong> For this project my group and I conducted multiple interviews with participants that fit the outlined target audience. From these interviews we extracted a lot of information about what causes people annoyances when trying to park and some key insights into possible solutions. Another large research method we used was observation. Each member of the group was responsible for observing people try and find parking spots in different parking lots. I personally watched the student Lot 43 for people trying to park and observed the difficulties people would face when looking for a spot.
                  </p>
                  <p> <strong>First App Design:</strong> Below is the first design for the app before we redesigned it using feedback. The actual prototype was edited so we only have screenshots of the original design to show.
                  </p>
                  <img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="img/portfolio/InitialDesign.png" alt="">
                  <p> <strong>Observation and Interview Findings:</strong> 
                  People had negative feelings of frustration and stress when trying to park around Penn State. 
				  Parkin is most challenging, stressful, and expensive during event weekends. 
				  Tailgating fields do not get good signal making it difficult to find spaces. 
				  Searching for tailgating spots is a long exasperating process. 
				  Drivers need to arrive very early for good parking. 
				  Parking garages are often full on the weekends. 
				  Student lots and apartment lots are often full during the weekdays. 
				  There are many restrictions on lots around campus. 
				  Student parking is very expensive and the lots are far from classes and the students’ residences.

                  <hr class="star-primary">
                  <p>This project involved creating a script that analyzes large amounts of firewall log data and parses through it for specific instances that meet a certain criteria. The script was written in Python and executes simple capabilities like counting the amount of times a certain IP appears and then printing that information to a text file. The picture below shows a screenshot of a simple script that goes through each log file looking for a specific IP and port number, and then records the amount of times it appears. This project is also one of my early experiences with Python before I had any sort of fundamental practice, and as such the code is very clunky. An improvement I could have made was recursively searching through each log file that was contained in the specific folder that had all of them instead of repeating the same block of code for each file. The file linked below is the entire document for this project that goes in more detail of each phase I completed.</p>

This project also touches on establishing a netfilter tpye firewall to filter out specific network packets, as well as establishing an ssh tunnel to bypass firewall rules.

                  <hr class="star-primary">
                  <p>In this lab, my group and I executed a simple Cross-Site Request forgery attack on a simulated social media site. It outlined how simple of an attack this can be, and how vulnerable people can be to this attack without having the proper defenses in place. This attack involved taking advantage of the cookie used to maintain a loged-in connection, and then forcing the target to click a malicious link that forced an action on their account. The first step of this attack was to analyse the POST and GET requests made on the site when adding friends or updating an account legitimately. This legitimate network traffic was used to craft malicious code that would launch a request that forcibly added a user to the targets friends list, and even updating the targets account with information. The steps taken during this process as well as detailed explanations of this process are outlined in the document linked below. The picutre below shows a POST and GET request being analyzed.</p>

                  <h2>Simple SQL Injection</h2>
                  <hr class="star-primary">
                  <p>This project was a very basic and guided SQL injection attack. It gave me a surface level understanding of how an SQL attack could happen and the types of information that could be extracted by it. The details of this lab are outlined in the lab document linked below. The below picture shows some of the information that was extracted from the site.</p>
